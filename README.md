# how-to-migrate-database-in-aws

<h1>How to migrate database in AWS</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I will be demonstrating how to set up a cloud based SIEM, as well as virtual machine in the cloud which will be the honeypot. It will be have vulnerabilities to the internet which I will monitor and log the attacks from different ip addresses, from different countries all over the world. I will extract the failed log on data and ingest it into Azure Sentinel and present it on a world map so you can visualize where the attacks are coming from.

<h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
From completing this project I was  able to understand how Azure Sentinel works and the benefits from using it in your environment.

Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. 
Azure Sentinel collects data from different data sources, performs data correlation, data visualization and processed the data in a single dashboard. It helps to collect, detect, investigate and respond to security threats and incidents.
